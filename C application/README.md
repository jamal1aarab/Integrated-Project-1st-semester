To access the application as an administrator, you will need a matricule and a password.

Here is the login information for the different roles:

Balance manager :

-Matricule: 1
-Password: solde123

Ticket manager

-Matricule: 2
-Password: resto123

It is important not to change an administrator's matricule.

But you can change the passwords by modifying the 'users.txt' file.
