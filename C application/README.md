# Management Application for our University's Restaurant System.

### Console App in C

To access the application as an administrator, you will need a matricule and a password.

Here is the login information for the different roles:

###Balance manager:

Matricule: 1

Password: solde123

###Ticket manager:

Matricule: 2

Password: resto123

It is important not to change an administrator's matricule.

But you can change the passwords by modifying the 'users.txt' file.
